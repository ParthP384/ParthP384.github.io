<li>One million Earths could fit inside the Sun.	
If a hollow Sun was filled up with spherical Earths then around 
960,000 would fit inside. On the other hand if these Earths were 
squished inside with no wasted space then around 1,300,000 would 
fit inside. The Sun’s surface area is 11,990 times that of the Earth’s.</li>&nbsp;

<li>The Sun contains 99.86% of the mass in the Solar System.</li> &nbsp;

<li>The mass of the Sun is approximately 330,000 times greater than 
that of Earth. It is almost three quarters Hydrogen, whilst most 
of the remaining mass is Helium.</li>&nbsp;

<li>The Sun is an almost perfect sphere.</li>&nbsp;

 <li>There is only a 10 kilometre difference in its polar diameter 
 compared to its equatorial diameter. Considering the vast expanse 
 of the Sun, this means it is the closest thing to a perfect sphere 
 that has been observed in nature.</li>&nbsp;

<li>The temperature inside the Sun can reach 15 million degrees Celsius. </li>&nbsp;

<li>At the Sun’s core, energy is generated by nuclear fusion, as Hydrogen 
converts to Helium. Because hot objects generally expand, the Sun would 
explode like a giant bomb if it weren’t for its enormous gravitational 
force. The temperature on the surface of the Sun is closer to 5,600 degrees 
Celsius.</li>&nbsp;

<li>Eventually, the Sun will consume the Earth. 
When all the Hydrogen has been burned, the Sun will continue for about
 130 million more years, burning Helium, during which time it will expand 
 to the point that it will engulf Mercury and Venus and the Earth. At this
 stage it will have become a red giant</li>&nbsp;

<li>The Sun will one day be about the size of Earth. 
After its red giant phase, the Sun will collapse, retaining its enormous mass, 
but containing the approximate volume of our planet. When this happens, it 
will be called a white dwarf.</li>&nbsp;

<li>Light from the Sun takes eight minutes to reach Earth. 
With a mean average distance of 150 million kilometres from Earth and 
with light travelling at 300,000 kilometres per second, dividing one 
by the other gives us an approximate time of 500 seconds, or eight minutes 
and 20 seconds. Although this energy reaches Earth in a few minutes, it will 
already have taken millions of years to travel from the Sun’s core to its surface.</li>&nbsp;

<li>The Sun travels at 220 kilometres per second. </li>&nbsp;

<li>The Sun is 24,000-26,000 light years from the galactic centre and it takes the Sun
 225-250 million years to complete an orbit of the centre of the Milky Way.</li>&nbsp;

<li>The distance from the Sun to Earth changes throughout the year. 
Because the Earth travels on an elliptical orbit around the Sun, the distance
 between the two bodies varies from 147 to 152 million kilometres. The distance
 between the Earth and the Sun is called an Astronomical Unit (AU).</li>&nbsp;

<li>The Sun is middle-aged. 
At around 4.5 billion years old, the Sun has already burned off about half of 
its store of Hydrogen. It has enough left to continue to burn Hydrogen for approximately
another 5 billion years. The Sun is currently a type of star known as a Yellow Dwarf.</li>&nbsp;

<li>The Sun has a very strong magnetic field. 
Solar flares occur when magnetic energy is released by the Sun during magnetic storms, 
which we see as sunspots. In sunspots, the magnetic lines are twisted and they spin,
 much like a tornado would on Earth.</li>&nbsp;

<li>The Sun generates solar wind. 
This is a stream of charged particles, which travels through the Solar System at 
approximately 450 kilometres per second. Solar wind occurs where the magnetic field 
of the Sun extends into space instead of following its surface.</li>&nbsp;
